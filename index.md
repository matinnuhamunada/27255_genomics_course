## Introduction and Overview
- On the last part of the course (week 10-12), you will learn how to obtain and analyze the DNA sequence of selected isolates to mine the DNA for relevant genetic information. First, you will extract DNA from your isolated pseudomonas (two per group) and subsequently prepare the DNA of a selected isolate for sequencing (one per group). The actual sequencing will be done using Nanopore MinION, a 3rd generation sequencing platform capable of real-time sequencing of very long reads (>200kb). You will perform sequence-based analysis using several online tools that will be presented in this tutorial.
- In your analysis, you will specifically focus on: potential secondary metabolites, metabolic capabilities, antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity.
The overall aim of week 10-12 is to obtain genomic information and study how it correlates with the phenotypic data you have obtained in the previous weeks. Finally, you will use all the data you have obtained throughout the course to evaluate your isolated strainsâ€™ potential and suitability as a production strain or for commercial use.

> ## Prerequisites
> Before starting the bioinformatics analysis, make yourself comfortable with the Galaxy platform by following the tutorials from the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/). I would recommend trying these two tutorials:
> - [Galaxy Introduction](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html)
> - [MRSA genome assembly with Nanopore](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/mrsa-nanopore/tutorial.html)
