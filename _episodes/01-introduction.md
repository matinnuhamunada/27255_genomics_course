## Introduction
For the bioinformatics analysis of your genomes, we will be working in Galaxy. There are two main online galaxy platforms; the global server: [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/) and the European server: [https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/). The global version has a slightly larger set of programs than the European version. However, the European version runs in general slightly faster, and therefore you are recommended using the European version. 

If you hadn't done so, make yourself comfortable with the Galaxy platform by following the tutorials from the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/). I would recommend trying these two tutorials:
1.	[Galaxy Introduction](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html)
2.	[MRSA genome assembly with Nanopore](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/mrsa-nanopore/tutorial.html)

## Overview of Genome Assembly Processes

## Importing and editing a published workflow
We have prepared a template workflow that you can edit and use in your genome assembly and annotation. Follow this step to import the workflow to your account:
1.	Go to [https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/)
2.	Click `Login or Register`. Create an account and activate (if you hadnâ€™t so)
3.	In a new tab, open this link: [https://usegalaxy.eu/u/matin_nuhamunada/w/27255matinnu](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/matin_nuhamunada/w/27255matinnu)
4.	On the top-right corner, click the `+` button (import workflow) 
5.	Click `start` using this workflow
6.	Click on the name of the newly imported workflow (`imported: 27255_matinnu`) and click `Edit`
7.	Explore the workflow
