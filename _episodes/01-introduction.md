## Introduction
For the bioinformatics analysis of your genomes, we will be working in Galaxy. 

There are two main online galaxy platforms; the global server: [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/){:target="_blank"} and the European server: [https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/){:target="_blank"}. The global version has a slightly larger set of programs than the European version. However, the European version runs in general slightly faster, and therefore you are recommended using the European version. 

## Overview of Genome Assembly Processes

## Importing and editing a published workflow
We have prepared a template workflow that you can edit and use in your genome assembly and annotation. Follow this step to import the workflow to your account:
1.	Go to [https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/){:target="_blank"}
2.	Click `Login or Register`. Create an account and activate (if you hadnâ€™t so)
3.	In a new tab, open this link: [https://usegalaxy.eu/u/matin_nuhamunada/w/27255matinnu](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/matin_nuhamunada/w/27255matinnu){:target="_blank"}
4.	On the top-right corner, click the `+` button (import workflow) 
5.	Click `start` using this workflow
6.	Click on the name of the newly imported workflow (`imported: 27255_matinnu`) and click `Edit`
7.	Explore the workflow

## Adding more analysis in your workflow
As you can see, the workflow only has three parts:
- QC & Filtering
- Assembly
- Polishing

Next, we would like to add more analysis in the workflow:
- Gene Calling & Annotation
